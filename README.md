# Notorious-Note-Taker
      
## Description:
      
This assignment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application's front end was already created and my task was to build the back-end and connect the two.  This note taker will allow you to add and delete your notes.
